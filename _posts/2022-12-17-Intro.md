To study vehicle crashes, we will be using data from Open Street Map (OSMnx) and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) to retrieve data on streets in Philadelphia's Northern Liberties neighborhood in order to visualize crash data. It is important to understand vehicle crashes and where they occur in order for transportation planners, engineers, architects, and policymakers to understand the approriate interventions needed and resources that need to be allocated in order to create safer streets and neighborhoods.
