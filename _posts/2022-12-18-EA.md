After wrangling and preparing the data, we begin to retrieve the OSMnx street network of the neighborhood using the OSMnx Python package.
![network]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/network.png)

We then utilize crash data from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) to receive crash data for the neighborhood. With this data, we are able to create a variable of crash index by calculating the total crashes by street and dividing by street length. We then take the log of this value and further normalize it between 0 and 1.
![crashindex]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/crashindex.png)

This provides us with a static map indicating the crash index of each street in the neighborhood.
